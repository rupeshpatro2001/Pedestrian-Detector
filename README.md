# Pedestrian Detector using OpenCV Python

A pedestrian detector is a computer vision system that utilizes various algorithms, such as Haar Cascades, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), or deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to identify and locate pedestrians within images or video streams. The detector analyzes visual data, recognizing patterns and features associated with pedestrians, and plays a vital role in applications like autonomous vehicles, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and surveillance. By accurately detecting and tracking pedestrians in real-time, these systems contribute to improved safety by helping prevent collisions and enhance overall situational awareness in diverse environments, ranging from city streets to crowded public spaces.
